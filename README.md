# MyBomberman

Bomberman made in aprox 9 hours of work. Each player has 3 lifes, regular bombs deal 1 damage per hit. If player gets hit by a bomb loses one life.

## Controls
### Player 1 - Gamepad
Left joystick - Movement
A or X - Place bomb
### Player 2 - Keyboard
AWSD - Movement
Space - Place Bomb

## Power Ups
Each time you kill a breakable brick (silver bricks) there is a chance of spawn one of the power ups:

- Speed Power Up (Metallic sphere): Increase your movement speed during a time frame.
- Damage Power Up (Golden sphere): During a time frame you can spawn a bomb that deals 3 of damage (one shoot), and also has a longer blast distance. If player doesn't use the bomb during the time frame, it returns to the normal state of spawn regular bombs.

## To do:
- Add a proper UI (Show current power up, show current health, UI flow to restart the game...)
- Add some kind of AI to manage enemies.
- Add more types of Power Ups.
